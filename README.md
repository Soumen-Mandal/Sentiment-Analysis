# Sentiment Analysis GitHub Repository

Business Perspective:

The Sentiment Analysis project is a valuable tool that businesses can leverage to gain insights into customer opinions and sentiments expressed in textual data. By using advanced natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project enables businesses to analyze and understand the emotions and attitudes of their customers towards their products, services, or brand. By incorporating sentiment analysis into business processes, organizations can make data-driven decisions, improve customer experiences, and enhance overall brand reputation.

Description:

**Sentiment Analysis** is one of the most used applications of data science in Real-World Analysis. As the whole world is dependent on Social Media, user opinion and explanation can help us to understand their sentiments and intentions.


I have taken a dataset from Twitter and tried my level best to explain you all the sentiments of users through multiple modelling and deep lerarning techniques.

This repository contains a sentiment analysis code implemented in Python, utilizing various machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify text data into positive or negative sentiment. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a powerful technique that can automatically determine the sentiment or emotional tone behind a piece of text.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone of a given text. It has various applications, including social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and more. This repository provides an end-to-end sentiment analysis solution, from data preprocessing to model building and evaluation.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-Learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- WordCloud
- Google Colab (for running the code in a Colab environment)

## Code Structure

The code is organized into several sections:

### 1. Data Preparation

- Importing necessary libraries and dependencies.
- Loading the sentiment analysis dataset.
- Data exploration and preprocessing, including handling missing values, data sampling, and feature extraction.

### 2. Text Preprocessing

- Text preprocessing involves cleaning and preparing the text data for modeling.
- Lowercasing, removing URLs, special characters, and stopwords.
- Tokenization, lemmatization, and word frequency analysis.

### 3. Data Visualization

- Visualizing the data using word clouds to understand the most common words in both positive and negative tweets.

### 4. Vectorization and Splitting

- Converting text data into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

### 5. Model Building and Evaluation

- Building and evaluating various machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Naive Bayes
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model

- Model evaluation includes accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

### 6. Model Comparison

- Comparing the performance of different models and selecting the best-performing one for sentiment analysis.

### 7. Model Saving, Loading, and Prediction

- Saving the trained models using pickle for future use.
- Loading a saved model to make predictions on new text data.

## Usage

To use this code for sentiment analysis, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the "Prerequisites" section.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine or your preferred environment.

3. Run the code in your Python environment.

4. Follow the code comments and documentation to understand the different stages of sentiment analysis.

## Model Selection

Based on the code provided in this repository, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) appears to be the preferred model for sentiment analysis due to its generalization performance. You can use the saved LSTM model for sentiment analysis on new text data.
